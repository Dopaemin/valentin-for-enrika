Will You Be My Valentine

This folder contains a lightweight scaffold for a "Will you be my Valentine?" web app.

What's included

- index.html — static HTML entry
- styles.css — basic styles
- script.js — minimal interactive behavior
- .gitignore — common ignores

How to run

- Open `valentin/index.html` in a browser to view the scaffold.

Next steps

- Implement the app flow and animations in `script.js`.
- Add unit tests and optional build tooling (Vite, Parcel) if you want a dev server.
